<p>今天是全国哀悼日。</p>
<p>第一次，学生们默默地走在了一起。没有以往官僚地讲话，大家只是单纯地聚在一起，默默地站着，听着响彻云空的尖啸，低下头，闭上眼，紧含着泪水，然后默默走开。</p>
<p>向受难者默哀。</p>
<p>先有天下缟素，然后中华崛起！</p>

<p>May 12th, 2008</p>
<p>A gloomy day in China.</p>
<p>I still remember in that day I was in the net cafe. Suddenly, I felt somebody was shaking my chair. Then I turned my head and stared at the one who sat beside me. But out of my mind, I found he was staring at me with the same light and I saw someone was running panicky.  “Earthquake!” I shouted and thrown away my earphone. Then kicked away the chair and ran out of the net cafe. At the same time, I saw panic people ran out to the street, some even naked and the sound of things falling on the earth went around my ears…</p>
<p>At first, I still believed it was just a small earthquake. But half a hour later, I knew the heart of this earthquake is away 57 miles from this city-Chengdu and the magnitude is 7.8!</p>
<p>An earthquake of 7.8 magnitudes!</p>
<p>My heart sank. What does an earthquake of 7.8 magnitudes mean? It’s almost 400 times of the power of the nuclear bomb which thrown on Hiroshima! Wenchuan, the city on the heart of this earthquake, was effaced from the earth.</p>
<p>At that night, all students chose to sleep outside on the ground. And the aftershock attacked again and again. What’s worse, it became cold and the sky began to rain…We had to move back into the first floor of the class building, but when we just moved in, the aftershock attacked once again, all students ran quickly out of it, screaming…</p>
<p>4 days have passed like this. Every night when I laid on the ground, I thought tomorrow would be another day and all the bad things would be over but…</p>
<p>But in fact, my life is like in the paradise if you compare it with the severely afflicted area. You can see the photos on the internet or TV and you’ll know what the hell is like. Because of the severely afflicted area is in the mountain area, because of the landslide and bad weather, nobody, even the army and the helicopter and paratrooper, was able to enter the severely afflicted area. Without food, without water, being buried under the fallen buildings, time is passing…hope, where is the hope?</p>
<p>BUT WE HAVE NOT LOST HOPE! Only two hours after the earthquake, our Prime Wen Jiabao hurriedly went to the severely afflicted areas and more than 10 thousand soldiers were transferred. (The number is a new record in our history.) The paratroopers tried to enter the area regardless of their lives. A teacher used her body to brace the ceiling to make a small space, saved a 5-month-old baby but lost her own life. A man saved scores of children, but his only son dead under the fallen building. More and more volunteers and relief supplies are coming form Beijing, Shanghai, Taiwan, Hongkong…all parts of this country. In my life, I have never seen the blood bank is full of the blood donator like this time.</p>
<p>As a special police, my cousins have been there. I do not only hope he will be safe, but also hope that he could save more people like those heroes.</p>
<p>But that is not enough. The government figured more than 5 thousand pepople has lost their lives. More and more injured people are being sent to Chengdu. We must to prevent plague… I feel powerless, especially when I saw a girl buried under the stone, the only way to save her is to saw off her legs…</p>
<p>What can we do? Donate materials and blood? Be a volunteer? Pray to all the Gods upon the sky?</p>
<p>So many people died…</p>
<p>The dead people closed their eyes. The only thing we can do is to save more people and let them go back to their peaceful and happy life. Even more peaceful and happier than before. Our Prime Wen Jiabao once said that every small problem times by 13 hundred million people will become a big problem and every big aggregate divided by 13 hundred million people, will become a small aggregate. Now we should say: a small sympathy times by 13 hundred million people, will become an ocean of love and a big problem divided by 13 hundred million people, will become nothing.</p>
<p>We are standing together!</p>
